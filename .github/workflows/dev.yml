# Name of the GitHub Actions workflow
name: 'Terraform CI/CD for dev Branch'

# Here we define the trigger for the workflow. It will run on 'push' events to the 'dev' branch
# and 'pull_request' events that target the 'stage' branch.
on:
  push:
    branches:         # When there is a push to branches
      - dev           # specifically the 'dev' branch
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, labeled]  # Types of pull request activities that trigger the workflow
    branches:
      - stage         # When pull requests target the 'stage' branch

# Permissions needed by the GitHub token to run the workflow.
permissions:
  id-token: write          # Workflow has write access to GitHub's OIDC token
  issues: write            # Workflow can create and modify issues
  pull-requests: write     # Workflow can create and modify pull requests
  contents: read           # Workflow can read the repository's content
